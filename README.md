# 4geniac

This repository provides a script to build and push on [4geniac](https://hub.docker.com/u/4geniac) docker hub regristry the containers which are used by [Geniac](https://geniac.readthedocs.io) to build the docker and singularity containers for each tool.

## Usage

The script `generateDistro.sh` allows the generation of the containers for several community-supported Linux distributions which are binary-compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). For each Linux distribution version listed in the file `linuxDistroVersion.txt`, it outputs a bash script that can build and push on the `4geniac` docker hub registry following:

* the `distro/version` with a minimal Linux `distro`
* all the possible `distro/version_conda-release`'s where `release` takes all the values listed in the first column of the file `condaRelease.txt`. This tag bootstraps from the `distro/version` tag.
* the `distro/version_sdk-conda-release` with development tools (which are required when a tool is installed from source by geniac, such as gcc, g++, cmake3, etc.) and conda. This tag bootstraps from the `distro/version_conda-release` tag.

Note that any tag already existing on the `4geniac` docker hub registry will be ignored in the output.

```
### For distro/version
bash generateDistro.sh distro > scriptDistro.sh
bash scriptDistro.sh

### For distro/version_conda-release's
bash generateDistro.sh distro+conda > scriptDistroConda.sh
bash scriptDistroConda.sh

### For distro/version_sdk
bash generateDistro.sh distro+sdk > scriptDistroSdk.sh
bash scriptDistroSdk.sh
```
